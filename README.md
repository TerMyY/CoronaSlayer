Tactical "Plague Inc" like game about saving the world from the virus.
My first attempt to create something decent via java swing.

Each country have it's own special traits and so does the virus. When a virus is affecting a country it mutates and get different traits.
Country and virus traits together define how fast a virus would spread, kill and slow down the vaccine development.
Your goal is to manage your score points right.
When the country is infected (it turns orange) vaccine development slows down in here by 15%.
When most of the country population is dead (it turns red) vaccine development stops in here.
Painfull virus trait slows down development by 15% more.

Lockdown - stops all outcoming flies in this country.
Research - boosts vaccine research impact for this country.
Advanced medecine stops people from dying if the virus has a lethal trait.
Painkillers - negotiate the effect of painfull virus trait.
Differnt resist removers do exactly what they sound - removes Virus resists so it spread slower across the country.
Burn corpses - stops the virus from spread through corpses.

You can download CoronaSlayer.jar file and run it.
